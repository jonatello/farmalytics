# farmalytics

This is a project revolving around inexpensive, readily available, non-proprietary hardware nodes utilizing environmental sensors that can be configured and designed in a way to send the data back to a centrally hosted and scalable backend composed primarily of the Elastic Stack. Unfortunately the name appears to have been used before in a 2017 coding project, this is unrelated to that :)

Most of the information will be within the wiki - https://github.com/jonatello/farmalytics/wiki
