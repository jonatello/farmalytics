# farmalytics

Most of the information will be within the wiki - https://github.com/jonatello/farmalytics/wiki

This is a project revolving around inexpensive, readily available, non-proprietary hardware nodes (Raspberry Pi's, namely) utilizing environmental sensors that can be configured and designed in a way to send the data back to a centrally hosted and scalable backend composed primarily of the Elastic Stack. 

Coincidentally the name appears to have been used before in a 2017 coding project, this is unrelated to that :)

My hope is that this could be a guide for repeatable technical solutions that can be applied to a wide range of problems. Tracking environmental data with nodes that can be physically purchased at mass and configured in a nearly automated manner is a central goal to that. I imagine this will eventually be useful for others, but my initial plans are to document the process in an open and generic way for my own environment first. A big part of that is prioritizing the data, and later integrating mechanical automations (power/lighting/water).
